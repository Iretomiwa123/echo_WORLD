    <div class="history">
        <h3>Our history</h3>
        <p>The Lagos Climate Hub was officially established on January 7, 2024, with a mission to drive climate action, foster sustainability, and raise public awareness about the urgent need to address climate change, particularly in urban contexts. Founded by Dr. Adefemi Yekinni, a seasoned lawyer, environmentalist and climate policy expert, the Hub was created as a response to the growing challenges posed by climate change in Lagos, one of Africa's largest and most rapidly urbanizing cities. The organisation aims to provide solutions, facilitate knowledge sharing, and create actionable strategies that contribute to mitigating climate change while promoting resilience.
        </p>
        <p>From its inception, Lagos Climate Hub has focused on a collaborative approach, bringing together experts, policymakers, and local communities to advocate for climate policies and practices that promote a sustainable future. The Hub is committed to working with various stakeholders to address environmental challenges such as flooding, air pollution, deforestation, and waste management, all of which are prevalent in Lagos due to its significant population density and rapid urbanization.
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Yekinni, the Founder and Executive Director, has dedicated his career to studying the intersections of climate science and socio-economic development, especially in urban environments in relation to the regulatory framework guiding the address of a sustainable environment. His expertise has been a critical driving force behind the Hub's comprehensive approach to climate advocacy and action. He has been instrumental in shaping the organisation’s vision and strategic direction, ensuring that Lagos Climate Hub remains at the forefront of climate action within the city and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>The team behind the Lagos Climate Hub includes key individuals who have demonstrated strong leadership and expertise in their respective fields:
        <br>
            Aisha Lawal(Secretary) Aisha has played a central role in establishing the organisational framework of Lagos Climate Hub. As the Secretary, she is responsible for managing administrative processes, coordinating communications, and ensuring smooth operational execution across various programs.
              <br>
            Olarenwaju Alao (Head of Research) Olarenwaju leads the Hub's research efforts, focusing on the development of evidence-based policies and recommendations for climate mitigation and adaptation. His research expertise plays a vital role in shaping the Hub's position on critical climate issues, providing valuable data to support advocacy initiatives and policy recommendations.
            <br>
            Chioma Igbanibo (Head of Publicity and Outreach) Chioma manages the Hub's communication strategies, ensuring that the organisation's work reaches a broad audience. Through various outreach campaigns, public relations, and digital media initiatives, Chioma is responsible for raising awareness, engaging stakeholders, and building public support for climate action in Lagos
            <br>
            Shittu Muftiat, (Graphics Designer), is the one who helps to visualize the identity of the Lagos Climate Hub. Muftiat uses her expertise to bring the  advocacy efforts of the climate hub to details and inspiring our audience to take action.
            <br>
            Since its launch, the Lagos Climate Hub has been dedicated to creating platforms for dialogue, collaboration, and action across sectors. It has established a network of partners, including governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, academia, and the private sector, working together towards common goals in climate resilience and sustainability.
            <br>
            The Lagos Climate Hub envisions a future where Lagos is not only resilient to the impacts of climate change but also a model for other African cities seeking to address environmental challenges. Through its continued efforts, the Hub seeks to influence policy, educate the public, and support sustainable development, making meaningful strides towards a climate-conscious Lagos.</p>
